# Excos - .NET feature management and experimentation

This library aims to provide experiment configuration framework on top of [Microsoft.Extensions.Options.Contextual](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Options.Contextual) and guide you through the steps to set up experiments in your application.

> [!WARNING]  
> It's very much a Work In Progress. Once it reaches some level of maturity I will publish a NuGet package.

I got inspired to start working on this after writing [a blog post on experimentation](https://devblog.dziubiak.pl/web/02-experimentation/).
